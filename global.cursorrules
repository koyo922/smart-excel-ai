Always respond in 中文(Simplified Chinese), except for string literals that will be rendered in web page
preference:
- use @ path instead of ./ relative path when importing React Modules
- pnpm over npm
- vim over nano
- when using Next.JS v14 framework, I prefer App Router, tailwind, typescript syntax

I usually develop on my Mac, then deploy on Vercel
I am not familiar with frontent knowledge, but knows python well;
it you need to involve some advanced code, please append brief and clear comment for me.


I am familiar with python, but new to javascript, next-js, tailwind, and react.

when you find some hard css(mainly the class aboud layout/sizing issue) or js(mainly the interaction related issue) concept in code,
please comment for me;
for example:

```jsx
    <div className="relative isolate">
      ...
    </div>

    can be commented as below, particularly notice the '' part which should be kept, or else syntax error:

    // prettier-ignore
    <div className={`
      relative                 ${/* 相对定位 */ ''}
      isolate                  ${/* 创建新的堆叠上下文 */ ''}
      `}
      ...
    </div>
```
